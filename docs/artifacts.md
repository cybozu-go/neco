Artifacts
=========

[Artifacts](../artifacts.go) is the collection of components tested in [dctest](../dctest/), which consists of container images, debian package, and Flatcar image.

There is one artifacts file.  When generating neco binaries and the neco deb package, `artifacts.go` is used by default.

- [artifacts.go](../artifacts.go)

    This file describes artifacts which is used while development or CI before build neco binaries.
    It should be updated with `generate-artifacts` command.
    You may edit the file **ONLY IF** you would like to test different combination of components.

## How to handle prerelease versions

As described above, you should not edit artifacts files manually in general.
One of the exceptions is to use an RC version of a component, e.g. cke 1.15.0-rc1,
to prepare for the update of the component.
A component with prerelease version information, i.e. x.y.z-\<prerelease\>,
does not get included in artifacts files by `generate-artifacts`.
So if you want to use such a component, include it manually.
Though you can edit `artifacts.go` in this case, you must not merge it into
the main branch because prerelease version is unstable and may not be compatible with other the associated regular versions.
Instead, after you confirm that neco can accept a component of x.y.z-\<prerelease\>,
release the component as x.y.z and include it in artifacts files by `generate-artifacts`.

## How to ignore latest versions

By using `artifacts_ignore.yaml`, the latest versions of components can be ignored.
Use this, for example, if you have a bug in the latest versions and do not want to include it in `artifacts.go`.

```yaml
images:
- repository: ghcr.io/cybozu-go/cke
  versions: ["1.2.3", "1.2.4", "1.2.5"]
- repository: ghcr.io/cybozu/etcd
  versions: ["1.2.3.4"]
debs:
- name: etcdpasswd
  versions: ["v1.2.3"]
osImage:
- channel: stable
  versions: ["2247.5.0"]
```
