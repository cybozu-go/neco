Placemat
========

Placemat is a tool to simulate data center networks and servers using [rkt][] Pods,
QEMU/KVM virtual machines, and Linux networking stacks.  Placemat can simulate
virtually *any* kind of network topologies to help tests and experiments for software
usually used in data centers.

Features
--------

* No daemons

    Placemat is a single binary executable.  It just builds networks and
    virtual machines when it starts, and destroys them when it terminates.
    This simplicity makes placemat great for a continuous testing tool.

* Declarative YAML

    Networks, virtual machines, and other kind of resources are defined
    in YAML files in a declarative fashion.  Users need not mind the order
    of creation and/or destruction of resources.

* Virtual BMC for IPMI power management

    Power on/off/reset of VMs can be done by [IPMI][] commands.
    See [virtual BMC](docs/virtual_bmc.md) for details.

* Automation

    Placemat supports [cloud-init][] and [ignition][] to automate
    virtual machine initialization.  Files on the host machine can be
    exported to guests as a [VVFAT drive](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Devices/Storage).
    QEMU disk images can be downloaded from remote HTTP servers.

    All of these help implementation of fully-automated tests.

* UEFI

    Not only traditional BIOS, but placemat VMs can be booted in UEFI
    mode if [OVMF][] is available.

Usage
-----

This project provides these commands:

* `placemat` is the main tool to build networks and virtual machines.
* `pmctl` is a utility tool to control VMs and Pods.

### placemat command

`placemat` reads all YAML files specified in command-line arguments,
then creates resources defined in YAML.  To destroy, just kill the
process (by sending a signal or Control-C).

```console
$ placemat [OPTIONS] YAML [YAML ...]

Options:
  -bmc-cert string
        Certificate file for BMC HTTPS servers.
  -bmc-key string
        Key file for BMC HTTPS servers.
  -cache-dir string
        directory for cache data
  -data-dir string
        directory to store data (default "/var/scratch/placemat")
  -debug
        show QEMU's and Pod's stdout and stderr
  -enable-virtfs
        enable VirtFS to share files between guest and host OS.
  -force
        force run with removal of garbage
  -graphic
        run QEMU with graphical console
  -listen-addr string
        listen address (default "127.0.0.1:10808")
  -run-dir string
        run directory (default "/tmp")
  -shared-dir string
        shared directory (default "/mnt/placemat")
```

If `-cache-dir` is not specified, the default will be `/home/${SUDO_USER}/placemat_data`
if `sudo` is used for `placemat`.  If `sudo` is not used, cache directory will be
the same as `-data-dir`.
`-force` is used for forced run. Remaining garbage, for example virtual networks, mounts, socket files will be removed.

### pmctl command

`pmctl` is a command line tool to control VMs, Pods and Networks.

See [pmctl](docs/pmctl.md)

Getting started
---------------

### Prerequisites

- [QEMU][]
- [OVMF][] for UEFI.
- [picocom](https://github.com/npat-efault/picocom) for `pmctl`.
- [rkt][] for `Pod` resource.
- [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) for `pmctl`.
- *(Optional)* [swtpm](https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm) for providing TPM of `Node` resource.

For Ubuntu or Debian, you can install them as follows:

```console
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils ovmf picocom socat cloud-utils
```

As to rkt, obtain a deb (or rpm) package then install it as follows:

```console
$ wget https://github.com/rkt/rkt/releases/download/v1.30.0/rkt_1.30.0-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i rkt_1.30.0-1_amd64.deb
```

### Install placemat

You can choose `go get` or debian package for installation.

Install `placemat` and `pmctl`:

```console
$ go get -u github.com/cybozu-go/placemat/pkg/placemat
$ go get -u github.com/cybozu-go/placemat/pkg/pmctl
```

or

```console
$ wget https://github.com/cybozu-go/placemat/releases/download/v${VERSION}/placemat_${VERSION}_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i placemat_${VERSION}_amd64.deb
```

### Run examples

See [examples](examples) how to write YAML files.

To launch placemat from YAML files, run it with `sudo` as follows:

```console
$ sudo $GOPATH/bin/placemat cluster.yml
```

To connect to a serial console of a VM, use `pmctl node enter`:

```console
$ sudo $GOPATH/bin/pmctl node enter VM
```

This will launch `picocom`.  To exit, type `Ctrl-Q`, then `Ctrl-X`.
